The files in this directory with suffixes `.t', `.d', `.r', `.rr' and
`.err' are used for testing ed.  To run the tests, set the ED variable in
the Makefile for the path name of the program to be tested (e.g., /bin/ed),
and type `make'.  The tests do not exhaustively verify POSIX compliance
nor do they verify correct 8-bit or long line support.

The test file suffixes have the following meanings:
.t    Template - a list of ed commands from which an ed script is
      constructed
.d    Data - read by an ed script
.r    Result - the expected output after processing data via an ed
      script.
.rr   Result from a piped ed script.
.err  Error - invalid ed commands that should generate an error

Autotest is used for testing.  At the top-level build directory, type
`make check' or `cd ./testsuite && make quick-check'.  The `quick-check'
target avoids rebuilding the test scripts on the fly.  The results of
the tests may be viewed in testsuite/*.dir.

The POSIX requirement that an address range not be used where at most
a single address is expected has been relaxed in this version of ed.
Therefore, the  following script templates are disabled:
=-err.t.posix
a1-err.posix
i1-err.posix
k1-err.posix
r1-err.posix

To use these, remove the .posix suffix and run the tests as described
above.
