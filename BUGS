KNOWN BUGS

* Paging algorithm should use UTF-8 character width instead of ASCII.

* Half-page scrolling assumes that the width of a printed line does
  not exceed terminal width. Scrolling by half pages through a file
  with long lines displays seemingly corrupt content, but does not
  affect the integrity of the internal editor buffer. Use full page
  scrolling if in doubt.

* Similarly, half-page scrolling of enumerations (i.e., `[n' and ']n'
  commands) and listings (i.e., `[l' and ']l' commands) is currently
  broken.
