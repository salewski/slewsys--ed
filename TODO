Last modified: 2011-03-09 <alm@slewsys.org>

These are more or less in decreasing order of priority.

* Pre-release
** Coordinate man and info pages
** Submit ed.pot to translation group
** Update testsuite
** Allow editing of wide-char and UTF-8 text.
** Implement named registers

   (.,.)m|t>[>][k] where optional k = 0, 1, ..., 9. Moves or copies,
   respectively, the addressed lines to register k (or default
   anonymous register, if k is not given). If `>>' lines are appended
   to end of register. Otherwise, any previous register contents are
   overwritten.
   
   <[k]m|t(.) where optional k = 0, 1, ..., 9. Moves or copies,
   respectively, contents of register k (or default anonymous
   register, if k is not given) to after the addressed line.

   <[k]m|t>[>][j] where optional k = 0, 1, ..., 9 and j = 0, 1, ...,
   9. Moves or copies, respectively, contents of register k (or
   default anonymous register, if k is not given) to register j (or
   default anonymous register, if j is not given). If `>>' lines are
   appended to end of register. Otherwise, any previous register
   contents are overwritten.

* I/O
** Speed up file I/O  via mmap(2), database and/or in-core buffer.

* File warnings
** Warn if disk file has changed since last write.
** Command-line option to force advisory lock warning on write.

* Limits
** get_path_max () should identify per filesystem limits, not POSIX limits.

* Undo
** Add multiple undo.
