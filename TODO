TODO: Possible improvements for the ed line editor.

These are more or less in decreasing order of priority.

* Pre-release
** Sync man and info pages
** Submit ed.pot to translation group
** Update testsuite
** Allow editing of wide-char and UTF-8 text.
** Allow linking against GNU Libc to pick up regex.

* I/O
** Speed up file I/O  via mmap(2), database and/or in-core buffer.

* File warnings
** Warn if disk file has changed since last write.
** Command-line option to force advisory lock warning on write.

* Limits
** get_path_max () should identify per filesystem limits, not POSIX limits.

* Undo
** Add multiple undo for the user (as opposed to undoing a global command).
