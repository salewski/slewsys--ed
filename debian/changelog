  * Fix memory leaks flagged by valgrind.

  * Add target `check-valgrind'.

  * Remove remainder of generated files.

  * Comply with REUSE Specification â€“ Version 3.0.

  * Apply script to each file on command line.
    For this to work, the script must be seekable. And to avoid infinite
    loops, if the script modifies the input file list, it is only applied
    to the first file on the command line.

  * Fix typo to prevent double-free on Linux.

  * In substitution templates, support case modifier sequences.
    As currently implemented, these only work for 8-bit locales.
    The sequences can be nested.

  * In substitution templates, a back-reference that does not match any
    subexpressions is now replaced with the empty string instead of the
    offending digit, as per The Open Group's 2018 publication (cf.
    https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/ed.html).

  * Restore missing REG_NOTBOL.
    Reported by Victor <vico/tuta.io>.

  * Report error if fflush fails.

  * Add CPP flag _FORTIFY_SOURCE=3.

  * Add configure option for command-line address arguments.

  * Silence clang format string warnings on arm and aarch64.

  * Handle edge case where backslash is used as pattern delimiter.

  * Support static builds.

  * Properly handle configure's disable feature options.
    Don't nest Autoconf macro AS_IF.
    Warn if an extension is enabled by another.

  * Add  autoreconf to GitHub actions.

  * Support GNU regex operators in extended regular expressions.

  * When `ed` is linked against a GNU regex library and invoked with
    either option `-E` or `-r`, then additional GNU regular
    expression short-hand operators are recognized.
