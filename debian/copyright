 Major mode for editing ed scripts of the form:
 .
 #!/path/to/ed -vf
 ... ed commands ...
 .
 `Compiling' such a script, via the command M-x compile, means
 running the script against a data file. Emacs can use any errors
 generated by running the script to jump to the offending line via
 C-x `.
 .
 If you need this major mode, you might also want to
 consider spending some time with `M-x doctor'.
