Ed is an implementation of the Unix line editor. It is 8-bit clean
with 64-bit addressing and the only open source implementation that
scores 100% on The Open Group's POSIX-compliance tests.

Ed also provides a handful of useful extensions to the SUSv4 standard,
as described in the file _doc/SUSv4_.

Brian W. Kernighan's ed tutorials are included courtesy of Lucent
Laboratories. See _doc/bwk/_ or, from within ed, type:

The ed algorithm is described in Kernighan and Plauger's book
_Software Tools in Pascal_, Addison-Wesley, 1981.
